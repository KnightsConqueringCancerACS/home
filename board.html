            At KCC (Knights Conquering Cancer), our mission is clear and passionate: we strive to raise as much money as possible to donate to the American Cancer Society (ACS). We are a team of eleven dedicated students from Bergen County Academies (BCA) in New Jersey, united by a common goal to fight cancer. Many of us are involved in advanced cell biology research, focusing on cancer-related projects. This academic background illustrates our commitment and equips us with the knowledge to approach our mission with scientific rigor and valuable insight. <br><br>Our team is organized into various “departments,” such as communications, advertising, and social media. We aim to officially establish the KCC as a recognized club within BCA, expanding our impact and spreading awareness for this devastating disease. Donate today. Do your part to fight cancer.

        <!-- Hi! I'm Danielle Abad and I'm so excited to be KCC's Social Media Manager! I'm in the Academy of Medical Science and Technology's graduating class of 2027 and I am a part of the Design, Outreach, and Research teams within KCC. As someone who has watched cancer irreversibly change lives, I hope that with my position I can educate and bring attention to the different aspects of cancer research as well as share meaningful stories from survivors. In my free time I love watching Chinese dramas, participating in Model UN conferences, painting my nails, singing in the car, and eating salmon sushi. -->

            <p class="bio">What's up guys! I'm Vedanti, in the Bergen County Academies class of 2027. I'm in the Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology and I am so grateful for this opportunity to better the lives of cancer patients through Knights Conquering Cancer. In my free time I love making jewelry, volunteering, practicing taekwondo, and painting. I also occasionally play volleyball and my favorite place to be in is the beach. Thanks for reading!</p>

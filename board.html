            At KCC (Knights Conquering Cancer), our mission is clear and passionate: we strive to raise as much money as possible to donate to the American Cancer Society (ACS). We are a team of seventeen dedicated students from Bergen County Academies (BCA) in New Jersey, united by a common goal to fight cancer. Many of us are involved in advanced cell biology research, focusing on cancer-related projects. This academic background illustrates our commitment and equips us with the knowledge to approach our mission with scientific rigor and valuable insight. <br><br>Our team is organized into various “departments,” such as communications, advertising, and social media. We aim to officially establish the KCC as a recognized club within BCA, expanding our impact and spreading awareness for this devastating disease. Donate today. Do your part to fight cancer.

I'm in the Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology and I am so grateful for this opportunity to better the lives of cancer patients through Knights Conquering Cancer. In my free time I love making jewelry, volunteering, practicing taekwondo, and painting. I also occasionally play volleyball and my favorite place to be in is the beach. Thanks for reading!</p>
